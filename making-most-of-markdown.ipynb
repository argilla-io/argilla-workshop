    "As you may have noticed, Argilla supports Markdown within its text fields. This allows you to add formatting to your text, such as **bold** or *italic* text, or even [links](https://www.google.com). Additionally, this also allows you to add all HTML content, such as images, videos, and even iframes, which is a powerfull tool to have at your disposal.\n",

    "We will be working with builtin Python libraries, as well as the `argilla` library. Additionally, we will use a unstructored document processor with a externally callable public API (to avoid overhead). This tool is called [IBM Deep Search](https://github.com/DS4SD/deepsearch-toolkit) but for a fully open source alternative, I recommend taking a look at [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io). To install the latter, run the following command:"
